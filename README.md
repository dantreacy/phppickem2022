# Notice Update

This will be an updated version of phppickem **WITH BREAKING CHANGES** suited for those who are starting fresh.

wishing to migrate to something more modern which is coming. 

If you're still using the former version and don't wish to go through the upgrade/migration process from time to time 
I'll be backporting some changes along with making some general changes and improvements at
